### User Story

As a web developer, I want a user-friendly task management application to help me stay organised and focused on my projects.

## Installation

To get Tasky App working, we have used different technologies and dependencies by running different commands in the terminal.

1. **Node.js**: If Node.js was never installed, we would have had to run the following command in the terminal:
    ```bash
    node -v
    ```

2. **NPM (Node Package Manager)**: Node.js usually comes with NPM. To check if we all had NPM installed, we would run:
    ```bash
    npm -v
    ```

3. **Next.js**: Tasky App is built with Next.js, a React framework. To install Next.js globally, we used:
    ```bash
    npm install -g next
    ```

4. **React**: Tasky App uses React for the user interface. We installed React using:
    ```bash
    npx create-react-app my-app
    ```

5. **Supabase**: Supabase is used for storing tasks data. We installed Supabase using:
    ```bash
    npm install @supabase/supabase-js
    ```

6. **React Date Picker**: To enable date selection, React Date Picker is used. We installed it via:
    ```bash
    npm install react-datepicker
    ```

7. **Lucide Icons**: Lucide icons are used for the app's iconography. We installed Lucide using:
    ```bash
    npm install lucide
    ```

8. **React DnD (Drag and Drop)**: React DnD was used for implementing drag-and-drop functionality. To install it, we ran:
    ```bash
    npm install react-dnd
    npm install react-dnd-html5-backend
    ```

9. **Framer Motion**: We used Framer Motion to add animations to the user interface. To install Framer Motion, we used:
    ```bash
    npm install framer-motion
    ```

10. **Tailwind CSS**: Tasky App is styled with Tailwind CSS. We installed it using:
    ```bash
    npm install tailwindcss
    ```

### Other Technologies Used:
- **Local Host**: Local Host was used to open app during development to see results of changes.
- **Version Control with Git**: Manage source code changes efficiently with Git.
- **GitHub**: Collaboratively host and manage the project repository on GitHub.
